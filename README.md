#Twitter Scraper

The Twitter Scraper is a Python script that allows users to scrape tweets from Twitter based on specified search criteria, date range, and maximum number of tweets. It utilizes the Tweepy library to interact with the Twitter API and provides options for text cleaning, parallel processing, error handling, and data saving.

## Features

- **Scraping Tweets**: Retrieve tweets from Twitter based on a search query, start date, end date, and maximum number of tweets.
  
- **Text Cleaning**: Automatically clean tweet text by removing special characters, URLs, non-ASCII characters, and extra whitespaces. Users can also specify custom characters to remove.

- **Date Validation**: Validate the format of user-provided start and end dates to ensure they are in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

- **Error Handling**: Catch and log exceptions that occur during the scraping process or other operations, providing informative error messages to users.

- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize parallel processing with ThreadPoolExecutor to scrape tweets concurrently, improving performance by making multiple API requests simultaneously.

- **Saving Data**: Give users the option to save the scraped tweet data to JSON or CSV files, providing flexibility for further analysis or storage.
